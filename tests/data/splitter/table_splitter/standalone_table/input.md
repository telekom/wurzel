| DataIngestor       | Load raw data from sources | 5.2                    | Connects to various data sources (APIs, databases, flat files) and loads raw, unprocessed data streams. |
| SchemaInferencer   | Infer structure and schema | 3.1                    | Analyzes raw data to automatically determine data types, structures, and inter-field relationships.     |
| EntityResolver     | Resolve entity duplicates  | 7.6                    | Uses fuzzy logic and ML techniques to merge similar records referring to the same real-world entity.    |
| OntologyTagger     | Semantic tagging           | 4.4                    | Enriches records by tagging entities and concepts based on a predefined or custom ontology.             |
| RelationshipMapper | Link related data entities | 6.3                    | Identifies and maps relationships between different data entities to build a coherent knowledge graph.  |
| DataCleaner        | Clean and normalize data   | 2.5                    | Removes duplicates, handles nulls, standardizes formats, and ensures consistency in datasets.           |
| PipelineVisualizer | Visualize the workflow     | 1.8                    | Renders interactive DAG-based visual representations of the pipelineâ€™s structure and flow.              |
| LineageTracker     | Track data provenance      | 2.9                    | Captures and visualizes the flow and transformation history of each data element in the pipeline.       |
| ModelDeployer      | Deploy models or insights  | 4.0                    | Supports seamless deployment of models or analytical results to APIs, dashboards, or external systems.  |
| FeedbackLoop       | Integrate human feedback   | 3.6                    | Allows integration of user feedback to refine, retrain or adjust knowledge representations dynamically. |
