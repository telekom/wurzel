# PyKnowFlow: An Awesome Python Framework for Knowledge Pipelines

## Core Features

PyKnowFlow is built with scalability and developer productivity in mind. Here are the core features that define its power:

### 1. Declarative Pipeline Configuration

PyKnowFlow uses YAML or JSON-based configuration files to define pipelines. This promotes reproducibility and allows non-developers to understand and modify workflows easily.

### 2. Intelligent Data Parsers

Data ingestion is made smarter with built-in parsers that can infer data types, schema, and even potential relationships between entities.

### 3. Graph-Based Workflow Execution

The framework models pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), similar to Airflow, but with richer semantics and better support for knowledge-specific operations like entity resolution, ontological tagging, and inference.

### 4. Built-In Ontology Support

PyKnowFlow supports integration with popular ontologies and knowledge bases. You can enrich your data with semantic metadata effortlessly.

### 5. Monitoring and Lineage Tracking

Track every transformation, every version, and every movement of data across the pipeline using intuitive visualizations and comprehensive logs.

## Example Use Case

Let’s say you’re working on a pipeline that extracts academic papers, identifies authors, links them to institutions, enriches the content with keywords and tags from an ontology,
