# Wurzel

Wurzel is an open-source Python library built to address advanced Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) needs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It is designed to streamline ETL processes while offering essential features like multi-tenancy, cloud-native deployment support, and job scheduling.

The repository includes initial implementations for widely-used frameworks in the RAG ecosystem, such as Qdrant, Milvus, and Hugging Face, providing users with a strong starting point for building scalable and efficient RAG pipelines.

## Features

- **Advanced ETL Pipelines**: Tailored for the specific needs of RAG systems.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Easily manage multiple tenants or projects within a single system.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Designed for seamless integration with Kubernetes, Docker, and other cloud platforms.
- **Scheduling Capabilities**: Schedule and manage ETL tasks using built-in or external tools.
- **Framework Integrations**: Pre-built support for popular tools like Qdrant, Milvus, and Hugging Face.
- **Type Security**: By leveraging capabilities of [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) we ensure type security
